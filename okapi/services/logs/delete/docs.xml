    <desc>
        <p>This method allows your user to delete own log entries.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='log_uuid'>
        <p>ID of the log entry to be deleted. The user of your
        Access Token must be the author of the log entry.</p>
    </req>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>success</b> - true, if the log entry was deleted;
                false if it could not be deleted,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>message</b> - plain-text string, a message for the user,
                which acknowledges success or describes an error (usually you
                want to display this only when success is false).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that <i>currently</i> you will always receive
        sucess=true (if the call did not fail due to an invalid ID, which
        will yield an HTTP 400 response). There are no restrictions on
        deleting own log entries. But that may change in the future; e.g.
        OC operators may decide that status-changing log entries cannot be
        deleted. So be prepared to receive success=false.</p>
    </returns>
