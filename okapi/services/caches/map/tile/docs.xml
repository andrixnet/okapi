        <p>ID of the user who's map view is requested. The current effect of
        this parameter is that caches found or owned by the user will be marked
        on the map. OCPL installations will also hide caches ignored by the user.
        If <b>view_user_uuid</b> is omitted, the UUID will be extracted from the
        access token.</p>
