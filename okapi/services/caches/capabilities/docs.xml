        <p>This method tells which geocache properties are available at this
        OKAPI installation.</p>
        
        <p>You may need it when
        <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>editing</a> geocache
        listings and when searching for caches by cache type. In all other
        cases, you don't need to know about differences between OKAPI
        installations. But still this method may help to improve usability
        of your app, e.g. by hiding unnecessary search options.</p>

                rating.</p>
